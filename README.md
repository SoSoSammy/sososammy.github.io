WELCOME TO MY *OFFICIAL* SOSOSAMMY WEBSITE!

After no joke, like three months I finally figured out how to use GitHub pages. And, in honor of that, drum roll please... 🥁 🥁 🥁

SoSoSammy version 0.4 is coming out! Wohoo! 🎊 🥳 🎊

The link, sososammy.github.io is where I will be putting my website. (It's already up, but I am going to be making lots of changes, so keep on the lookout for that.)
